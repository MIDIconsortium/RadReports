# RadReports
This repository contains easy-to-use apps for labelling neuroradiology imaging datasets on the basis of radiology reports, as detailed in our papers: 


Deep learning to automate the labelling of head MRI datasets for computer vision
applications, European Radiology, 2021.

Labelling imaging datasets on the basis of neuroradiology reports: a validation study, MICCAI LABELS Workshop, 2020

FastLabellerV5 is an app suitable for generating binary labels (i.e., 'normal' vs. 'abnormal'); SLowLabellerV5 is an app suitable for generating more specialised labels (i.e., 'mass'/'no mass', 'stroke'/'no stroke', 'small vessel disease'/'no small vessel disease' etc.)

These apps are tested on Windows operating system.
